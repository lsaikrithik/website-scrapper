6) 6) Goodfellas
Description: 1972Well, if Stanley Kubrick described it as "possibly the greatest movie ever made," who is anyone else to argue? Francis Ford Coppola's gangster-movie-redefining adaptation of Mario Puzo's Mafia novel is the Empire Greatest Movies Poll No. 1 incumbent, and for a very good reason. It sits right at the juncture between 'classic' and 'modern' cinema; it feels respectably venerable, while at the same time vibrant and vital â€” not a dry, cinematic relic that you feel obliged to bow before, but a hot-blooded, living god that you embrace.The classicism is in no small part down to Coppola and cinematographer Gordon Willis' genius decision to shoot it with a minimum of modern film-making bells and whistles. We see the Corleones' '40s and '50s New York at eye level, never via the rooftop-scudding bird's-eye view of the helicopter-camera lens. And, in keeping with its underworld setting, it's moodily, dimly lit throughout, its underexposure lending it an aged, sepia-tinged quality.The modernism, meanwhile, is felt not only in its squib-heavy bloodletting, but also the way it handles the gangster flick itself. Back in the genre's heyday, Hays Code restrictions ensured it could only dole out rise-and-fall tales which established in no uncertain terms that the Mob was a seething, violent force of corruption that a good society would always quell. Here, though, we had an Italian-American film-maker (the first to make an American gangster film) showing the Mafia as something, if not quite sympathetic, certainly more human; an organisation which is very much the product of society, rather than simply a malevolent, morally alien force.That theme, of course, being brilliantly embodied by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone: the World War II hero, determined to stay distant from his Dad's dodgy business but who ultimately becomes enwrapped in its soul-tainting shadows. Brando may get the most attention as the wheezing Don, but there's no denying this is really Pacino's show.Read Empire's review of The GodfatherBuy the film here

Description: The original "this one's darker" sequel, and by far the strongest of the saga. Not just because the baddies win (temporarily), or because it Force-slammed us with that twist ("No, I am your father"). Empire super-stardestroys thanks to the way it deepens the core relationships â€” none more effectively than Han and Leia's. She loves him. He knows.

Description: 1994The warm, leathery embrace of Morgan Freeman's narration... The reassuringly Gary Cooper-ish rumple of Tim Robbins' face... Odd that a movie which features such harshness and tragedy should remain a feel-good perennial â€” even odder when you consider it was a box-office flop on release.

Description: 1990Where Coppola embroiled us in the politics of the Mafia elite, Martin Scorsese drew us into the treacherous but seductive world of the Mob's foot soldiers. And its honesty was as impactful as its sudden outbursts of (usually Joe Pesci-instigated) violence.

Not that any studio these days would dare put out a summer blockbuster that's half monster-on-the-rampage disaster, half guys-bonding-on-a-fishing-trip adventure.

Description: 1979On the one hand, re-watching Ridley Scott's deep-space monster-slasher (and it's a movie which can handle as many re-watches as you can throw at it) makes you appreciate why he keeps coming back to that universe: it's so intoxicatingly atmospheric and deeply compelling, it sticks to you like a parasite.

Description: 1986The genius of James Cameron's self-penned Alien follow-up was to not try to top the original as one of the greatest ever horror movies.

Description: 1999After all the pre-release hype about how dark and brutal Fight Club was, one of the most surprising things to discover on seeing it was just how funny it actually was. And just as well; if you weren't laughing at Bob's "bitch-tits" or Tyler Durden's human-fat soap-making antics, it would be pretty hard to process David Fincher's bravura take on Chuck Palahniuk's tale of modern masculinity running insanely rampant.Read Empire's review of Fight ClubBuy the film here

Description: 1942When you've got such a clear-cut good-vs-evil scenario as World War II, it takes guts to put out a film which lets its (anti-) hero lurk for so long in a grey area of that conflict â€” while said War was still raging, no less. Of course, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) eventually does the right thing, but watching him make both the Resistance and the Nazis squirm right up to the final scene is truly joyous.Read Empire's review of CasablancaBuy the film here

Description: 1998You've got to hand it to the Coen brothers. Not only did they make arguably the funniest movie of the '90s â€” which has since spawned a genuine film cult â€” they also managed to construct a kidnap mystery in which the detective isn't a detective and nobody was actually kidnapped. With bowling, marmots and a urine-stained rug.Read Empire's review of The Big LebowskiBuy the film here

64) 64) L.A. Confidential
Description: 1995Aka David Fincher's second debut movie. What sounded like a daft, novelty serial-killer thriller turned out to be a deeply rattling proper-shocker, which had the guts to throw down its biggest narrative twist halfway through, as warped murderer-moralist John Doe gives himself up. A twist made all the more effective thanks to Kevin Spacey's insistence he wasn't billed until the end credits.Read Empire's review of SevenBuy the film here

Description: 1993Spielberg's masterpiece, hands down. You might say the shark looks fakey in Jaws. You may wonder how Indy clung to the German sub in Raiders.

Description: 2014It's official, then. The Marvel Studios movie most-beloved by Empire readers is the one which featured the MCU's freakiest and least-known characters (a talking racoon, a walking tree, a green assassin lady, a muscleman named after a Bond villain and Star-who!?), starred that schlubby fellah from Parks And Rec, and was directed by the guy who turned Michael Rooker into a giant slug-monster in Slither.

76) 76) A Clockwork Orange
Description: 2006And any argument about whether or not American remakes can ever be better than the foreign-language originals should be ended pretty quickly by mentioning this movie. Martin Scorsese's Boston-based reinterpretation of Wai-Keung Lau and Alan Mak's Hong Kong-set double-infiltrator crime drama Infernal Affairs is both respectful and unafraid to layer on extra detail. It's also perfectly cast: DiCaprio and Damon as the facing-off moles, Nicholson as the Whitey Bulger-esque Mob boss and (arguably best of all), Mark Wahlberg as America's sweariest cop.Read Empire's review of The DepartedBuy the film here

Description: 1957Juries most often amount to little more than set dressing in courtroom dramas. But Sidney Lumet's film finds all its drama outside the courtroom itself and inside a jury deliberation room packed with fantastic character actors, who are forced to re-examine a seemingly straightforward case by lone-voice juror Henry Fonda.

Even so, it feels like Foster's movie more than anybody's: her vulnerable-but-steely Clarice Starling is defined by her ability, not her gender.Read Empire's review of The Silence Of The LambsBuy the film here
